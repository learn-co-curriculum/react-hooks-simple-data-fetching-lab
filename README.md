# React Fetch Lab

## Objectives

- Practice creating a React component that utilizes `fetch` to display content

## Deliverables

This lab is missing the App component that `index.js` is looking for. To pass
the tests in this lab:

- Create an `App` class component from scratch
- Write a `componentDidMount` method. Inside the method, send a `fetch` request to
  http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json, a free API that returns a list of people
  currently in space.

**Note:** This lab uses some packages that need a relatively new version of
node. If you've got [nvm][https://github.com/creationix/nvm], run
`nvm install node` to update.
